AI: Earning $3,000 online by writing content is a feasible goal, but it requires strategy, persistence, and honing your skills. Here are some steps to help you achieve this:

1. **Identify Your Niche**: Determine what topics you are passionate about and knowledgeable in. Popular content niches include technology, finance, health, lifestyle, travel, and digital marketing.

2. **Build a Portfolio**: Create a collection of your best writing samples. If you're just starting out, consider writing guest posts, creating content for your own blog, or volunteering to write for non-profit organizations to build your portfolio.

3. **Freelance Platforms**: Sign up on freelancing sites such as Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr, and ProBlogger. These platforms connect writers with clients looking for content creation services.

4. **Network and Outreach**: Use platforms like LinkedIn to network with potential clients. Join writing and industry-specific groups and forums where clients may be looking for writers.

5. **Pitch to Websites**: Many websites and blogs pay for guest posts, especially if they're in your niche. Research sites that accept submissions and pitch article ideas tailored to their audience.

6. **Content Mills and Agencies**: While they might not pay as well, starting with content mills or writing agencies can provide steady work and build experience. Examples include Textbroker and Copify.

7. **Set Competitive Rates**: When you're starting, be competitive with your pricing. As you gain more experience, you can increase your rates gradually. Remember to charge based on the research required, the complexity of the content, and your level of expertise.

8. **Develop a Personal Brand**: Create a website or blog highlighting your writing services, portfolio, and testimonials from clients. A strong online presence can lead to more direct work offers.

9. **Offer Unique Services**: Consider branching out into related areas such as copywriting, scriptwriting for videos, social media content, or email newsletters. Offering diverse services can attract more clients.

10. **Stay Consistent and Keep Improving**: Regularly update your skills and stay informed about changes in SEO practices, writing trends, and new platforms. Consistency and improvement can significantly enhance your prospects.

By implementing these strategies and putting in dedicated effort, you can achieve your financial goals through content writing. Good luck!
